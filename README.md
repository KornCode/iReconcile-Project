# iReconcile-Project
Summary 
Bank reconciliation is a process in bookkeeping that explains the difference of date between the bank money in and money out in an company or organization's bank statement. This process is the final step of accounting to ensure that their ledger statement is correct (legally), before closing the account, then submit the report to the customs department. Even though bank reconciliation is the last working step, it takes around 40% - 50% of working time in total. Due to checking each transaction one by one with hand, which lead to human errors and re-checking. According to my supervisor, most small to medium size company in thailand still rely on this process.
Our system aims to make bank reconciliation easier by developing a web application that provides good UI and UX for accountant. Moving from working on paper to web application. Reduce human errors and finished the job faster. Also, the application can performs auto pair transactions for user. Then, user can edit or confirm it later.
